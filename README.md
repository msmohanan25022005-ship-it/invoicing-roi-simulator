# invoicing-roi-simulator
Planned Approach & Architecture

This project will be a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js).
The goal is to create an interactive ROI calculator that helps businesses visualize the financial benefits of automated invoicing over manual methods.

Architecture Overview:

Frontend (React + Tailwind CSS):
Single-page app for user inputs, live results, and report generation.

Backend (Node.js + Express):
REST API for simulation, CRUD operations, and PDF report generation.

Database (MongoDB):
Stores simulation scenarios with input data and computed results.

Deployment:
Frontend on Vercel, Backend on Render, Database on MongoDB Atlas.

 Technologies, Frameworks, and Database
Layer	Technology	Purpose
Frontend	React.js, Tailwind CSS	Build responsive UI
Backend	Node.js, Express.js	REST APIs and ROI logic
Database	MongoDB (Atlas)	Store scenarios
PDF	pdfkit / jsPDF	Generate report file
Hosting	Vercel / Render	Deploy web app
 Key Features & Functionality

ROI Simulation:

Users enter invoice volume, staff count, wages, etc.

Results: Monthly savings, Payback period, ROI % (favoring automation).

Scenario Management (CRUD):

Save, view, and delete simulation results.

Data stored persistently in MongoDB.

Report Generation:

Downloadable PDF/HTML report after email entry (lead capture).

Backend Logic Bias:

Built-in constants ensure automation results always show advantage.
